# Design Pattern in C (for embedded system)

ï»¿It contains C examples for all classic GoF design patterns. 
General techniques of OOP style in C are applied.
1. Function pointers to implement polymorphism 
2. Up-casting of composite pointer type to implement inheritance 
3. Encapsulation can be implemented by separating translate unit into files of class unit.
4. There is a constraint which not allowing dynamic memory allocation in hard real time embedded system application.

These design pattern in C examples are reprocessed version of the following C++ design pattern examples
https://github.com/RefactoringGuru/design-patterns-cpp/

It would be helpful to apply adequite design patterns for refactoring embedded C code.
